# You.md — Changelog

## 2026-04-16 — MCP Launch Hardening for Local Dev + Codex

### MCP / CLI Reliability
- **Fixed Codex startup in the `youmd` repo:** the Codex MCP launcher now uses the local `cli/dist/index.js` build when your working directory is this repo, so developing the CLI/MCP no longer collides with the root app package also being named `youmd`
- **Safe generated MCP config:** `youmd mcp --json` and `youmd mcp --install ...` now emit an explicit published-package launcher instead of bare `npx youmd mcp`, avoiding package-name collisions in monorepos or source checkouts
- **Updated install UX:** dashboard/docs/CLI copy now points people at the safe MCP install command for Claude Code and Cursor
- **Result:** you can dogfood the newest local MCP implementation while building `youmd`, but everywhere else Codex still uses the published npm CLI like a normal user

## 2026-04-15 — QA Sprint: Web Shell Parity + AI Leader Seeding

### Web Shell — Feature Parity with CLI
- **`/history` + `/analytics` routing:** both commands now route to their panes (were missing from `paneCommands` map in `useYouAgent.ts`); `/versions` aliases `/history`, `/stats` aliases `/analytics`
- **`/help` rewrite:** shell help text now lists all 25 commands in 7 sections (identity, sharing, skills, account, data, memory, system)
- **HelpPane:** commands reference completely rewritten with 7 categorized sections + accent-colored headers; added previously missing commands (`/json`, `/files`, `/sources`, `/activity`, `/portrait show`, `/portrait --regenerate`, `/skill use {name}`, `/analytics`, `/history`)
- **SkillsPane:** each skill card now shows a "use in shell" copy button — clicking copies `/skill use {name}` to clipboard with visual confirmation

### Seeding — 20 AI Leader Profiles
- Added `seedAiLeaders` internalMutation to `convex/seed.ts`
- Added `cleanDuplicates` utility mutation
- Seeded 20 top AI founders/influencers in prod (all 20 created, 0 skipped):
  sama, gdb, hwchase17, ylecun, jeremyphoward, emollick, swyx, svpino,
  rileytomasek, danshipper, gregisenberg, linusekenstam, alexandrwang,
  saranormous, clemdelangue, reidhoffman, natfriedman, andrewng,
  darioamodei, ilyasut
- Used GitHub avatars where available (unavatar.io/github/handle)

### Infrastructure
- **Fixed Convex deploy:** removed `"allowJs": true` from `convex/tsconfig.json` — was causing esbuild to pick up both `.ts` and `.js` versions of every file, crashing with "Two output files share the same path"

## 2026-04-15 — Profiles Directory Upgrade + Seeding Plan

### /profiles Page
- **Deduplication:** entries now deduplicated by username in frontend `useMemo` (profiles source wins over legacy); `listAllLegacy` already deduplicates at backend
- **Grid view:** added `ProfileGridCard` component + list/grid toggle (List/LayoutGrid icons) — state persists in session
- **Search expanded:** bio text now included in search filter (was: name, tagline, location only)
- **New filter:** `has-portrait` filter added alongside all/claimed/has-projects
- **Stats line:** header now shows portrait count alongside profile + claimed counts

### Seeding Plan
- Created `project-context/SEEDING_PLAN.md` with:
  - 3-tier target list (Tier 1: 100 AI leaders, Tier 2: 200, Tier 3: 500+)
  - 9-stage pipeline per profile (Perplexity identity → X enrichment → GitHub → website → LinkedIn → compile → ASCII portrait → quality review → publish)
  - Data sources + rate limits (GitHub 60/hr, Apify for LinkedIn, Grok-3-mini for X)
  - Quality standards table per tier
  - Deduplication rules
  - Batch sizes + pacing guide
  - SEO/AEO optimization specs (JSON-LD Person schema, OG, canonical URL, sitemap)

## 2026-04-14 — Agent Tool_Use Fix + Stale Build Cleanup

### Agent Harness — Proper Tool Execution (CRITICAL FIX)
- **Root cause:** Agent was hallucinating actions. Claimed to "scaffold directories" and "update files" without actually calling any mutations. No structured `tools` array was sent to Anthropic API, so the model emitted free-text JSON blocks that were often skipped or malformed.
- **Fix:** Implemented Anthropic `tool_use` in the streaming pipeline end-to-end:
  - `convex/http.ts`: New `transformAnthropicStream()` accumulates `input_json_delta` events and emits `{"tool_use": {...}}` SSE events on block stop; added `update_profile` + `save_memory` tool schemas to Anthropic API call
  - `src/hooks/useYouAgent.ts`: `callLLMStreaming` now returns `{ text, toolCalls }`; callers extract updates/memories from tool calls directly rather than regex-parsing JSON blocks; OpenRouter fallback still uses JSON block parsing for backwards compatibility
  - `src/hooks/agent-utils.ts`: System prompt updated to instruct agent to use tools as primary mechanism
- **Also fixed:** Removed stale compiled `.js` files from `convex/` that were conflicting with fresh Convex bundle and blocking all deployments

## 2026-04-14 — Top 5 Priority Sprint

### Chat Agent Reliability
- **Streaming init:** greeting now streams token-by-token instead of waiting for full response (switches from `callLLM` → `callLLMStreaming` in `initConversation`)
- **Faster responses:** reduced `max_tokens` from 4096 → 1500 (streaming endpoint) and 4096 → 2048 (non-streaming). Agent is meant to be concise — large token limits were generating unnecessary latency.

### MCP Server (Priority 4 — NEW)
- **Full MCP endpoint:** `/api/v1/mcp` — JSON-RPC 2.0 compliant Model Context Protocol server
- **Tools:** `get_identity(username)`, `search_profiles(query?)`, `get_my_identity` (auth required)
- **Resources:** `identity://{username}` resource type
- **Discovery:** `GET /.well-known/mcp.json` returns server capabilities + endpoint URL
- **Discovery ping:** `GET /api/v1/mcp` returns server info
- Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf can now connect to you.md as an MCP server

### Portrait in Chat
- **`/portrait show` command:** renders the user's current avatar and all scraped social images inline using `![platform](url)` markdown (rendered by TerminalBlocks as real images)
- Shows which source is active and prompts to switch

### CLI → Web Sync
- **avatarUrl sync:** portrait endpoint (`POST /api/v1/me/portrait`) now also patches `avatarUrl` from `portrait.sourceUrl` when profile has no avatar — CLI-generated portraits now appear as profile photo on web
- **`updateProfile` httpAction compat:** added `_internalAuthToken` bypass so httpActions can call it without Clerk JWT

## 2026-03-27 — Identity-Aware Skill System

### CLI Skill System (Phase 1-5 complete)
- **New command:** `youmd skill` with 12 subcommands (list, install, remove, use, sync, add, push, link, init-project, improve, metrics, search)
- **Skill catalog:** YAML-based catalog (`youmd-skills.yaml`) with scope, identity_fields, version tracking
- **Template engine:** `{{var}}` interpolation resolves against live identity data (profile, preferences, voice, directives)
- **4 bundled skills:** claude-md-generator, project-context-init, voice-sync, meta-improve
- **Agent linking:** Claude Code (.claude/skills/youmd/), Cursor (.cursor/rules/youmd.md), Codex targets
- **init-project compound command:** CLAUDE.md + project-context/ + .claude/skills/ in one shot
- **CLAUDE.md merge:** Appends identity section to existing CLAUDE.md files instead of skipping
- **Cross-project sync:** push/pull/sync auto re-interpolate installed skills on identity changes
- **Meta-improvement:** Identity coverage bars, unused skill detection, actionable proposals
- **Metrics tracking:** Usage counts, identity field references, install history
- **Batch operations:** `youmd skill install all` / `youmd skill remove all`
- **npm packaging:** Skills shipped with package via cli/skills/

### CLI Polish
- BrailleSpinner personality labels on build, skill, and all async commands
- Status command shows skills count, identity coverage bar, voice/ directory tree, actionable recommendations
- Push completion shows "what's next" recommendations
- Build command uses BrailleSpinner (was basic Spinner)
- Onboarding flow offers skill init-project after project detection

### Web Dashboard
- **New:** SkillsPane — skills tab in dashboard with catalog, CLI commands, how-it-works, scope explanation
- **New:** `/skills` slash command in CommandPalette + help text
- **New:** "skills" tab in desktop + mobile nav

### Files
- 13 new files (4 CLI lib, 1 command, 4 bundled skills, 4 source skills)
- 13 modified files (6 CLI commands, 2 CLI lib, 1 CLI config, 3 web components, 1 web hook)
- 1 new dependency: js-yaml

---

## 2026-03-24 — Intelligent Model Routing & Portrait System

### Model Routing
- **Named model config** — `MODELS` map in chat.ts routes tasks to the right model: Claude Sonnet 4.6 for chat, Perplexity Sonar for research, Sonar Pro for identity verification, Grok-3-mini for X enrichment, Haiku for summaries/classification
- **Identity verification** — new `verifyIdentity` action uses Perplexity Sonar Pro to cross-reference scraped profiles and confirm they belong to the same person. Returns confidence score, matching signals, and discrepancies
- **Parallel execution** — verification runs alongside research during scraping, both injected into agent context for informed conversation
- **HTTP endpoint** — POST /api/v1/verify-identity for external use

### Portrait System
- **Multi-image storage** — ALL scraped images saved to `socialImages` field (x, github, linkedin, custom). Previously only saved the best one to avatarUrl
- **Tap-to-select** — click any source image in PortraitPane to make it primary. Calls `setProfileImages` mutation
- **Real photo + ASCII** — each source shows actual photo preview alongside ASCII conversion
- **4 ASCII formats** — Classic ($@B%...), Braille (⣿⣷⣶⣦⣤), Block (█▓▒░), Minimal (@%#*+=-:.)
- **Detail picker** — 60/80/100/120/160 column presets. Default bumped to 120 (was 80)
- **Format picker** — grid selector for switching between ASCII formats in real-time
- **Public profile** — now renders at 120 columns desktop / 60 mobile (was 60/40)

---

## 2026-03-24 — Agent Directives & Proactive Agent UX

### Agent Directives (directives/agent.md)
- **New bundle section** — `directives/agent.md` gives any AI behavioral instructions for how to interact with the user: communication style, pet peeves (negative prompts), default tech stack, decision-making framework, and current goal
- **Compiled into youJson** — `agent_directives` object with `communication_style`, `negative_prompts`, `default_stack`, `decision_framework`, `current_goal`
- **Compiled into youMd** — human-readable "Agent Directives" section
- **Share block integration** — context links now include directive summary so agents get behavioral instructions immediately
- **Proactive extraction** — agent observes how users communicate and infers directives without being asked (short answers = concise preference, technical language = skip explanations)
- **Progressive depth updated** — L2 questions now include stack and communication preferences, L3 includes pet peeves and decision framework

### "Always Building" Agent UX
- **"building" thinking category** — 10 new thinking phrases for when the agent is constructing identity primitives, encoding preferences, structuring directives
- **More granular activity simulation** — 7 sub-steps during LLM wait (vs 3), with tighter intervals (1.5s, 3.5s, 6s, 9s, 13s, 18s, 24s) so the UI never feels static
- **Faster phrase rotation** — thinking phrases rotate every 2.5s (was 3.5s) for a more dynamic feel
- **Category-aware rotation** — each simulated sub-step rotates both the phrase AND category, so the thinking indicator shows contextual work (discovery -> analysis -> identity -> building)
- **soul.md "Always Building" philosophy** — agent now acts on inferences immediately instead of asking permission for obvious updates
- **Proactive update language** — "adding that to your projects now" instead of "want me to add that?"

---

## 2026-03-24 — Real-Time Progress Indicators (Claude Code-style)

### Activity Log System
- **ActivityLog component** — Claude Code-style step-by-step progress display showing what the agent is doing in real-time (fetching sources, researching context, generating response, saving updates, publishing)
- **ProgressStep tracking** — each async operation (scrape, research, LLM call, save, publish) gets its own progress step with running/done/error status and elapsed time
- **ThinkingIndicator enhanced** — now shows the activity log underneath the thinking phrase when steps are active
- **Typewriter effect** — latest assistant message streams in character-by-character with a blinking cursor for a natural terminal feel
- **Init flow progress** — session initialization (auto-scrape, auto-research, greeting generation) now shows step-by-step progress instead of going silent
- **Per-source scrape tracking** — each source being scraped gets its own progress line that completes independently as results come in

### UX Improvements
- Users always see exactly what the agent is working on — no more silent waiting
- Progress steps show elapsed time per operation
- Failed steps clearly marked with error indicator
- Steps auto-clear after completion with a brief delay to show final state

- **SettingsPane** — merged account, api keys, billing, activity log, help/commands reference into single scrollable pane

### Share UX Improvements
- **Agent-specific prompt templates** — select Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, Copilot, or Universal and get a tailored prompt with your identity link
- **One-click copy** — prominent "copy prompt + link" button copies the full share block to clipboard
- **Expiring link generation** — generate scoped 7-day context links directly from the Share pane
- **/share command** — now also switches to Share pane for visual confirmation
- **/publish command** — switches to Share pane (was separate publish pane)

### Terminal Command Updates
- All legacy slash commands (/preview, /agents, /billing, /tokens, /activity, /portrait) still work via aliases
- /help text updated to reflect new 4-tab structure
- /profile, /edit, /share as new primary navigation commands

- **Terminal aesthetic preserved** — monospace typography, 1px borders, `> active` indicators, burnt orange accent for active state

## 2026-03-21 — Agent Personalization, Auto-Scraping, UI Consistency Pass

### Agent Intelligence
- **Auto-scrape on session init** — returning users with links in their profile get auto-scraped before the first LLM greeting, so the agent greets with real, specific context
- **Auto-research for sparse profiles** — Perplexity web research triggers for new/sparse users with a display name
- **Smarter profile image selection** — prefers LinkedIn > GitHub > X when selecting avatar from scrape results
- **Real scraping integration** — LinkedIn via Apify, X/GitHub via scrape endpoint, Perplexity research — all injected into conversation as real data

- **Border radius standardized to 2px** across entire app (was 4px/8px in many places)
- **Pricing section** — terminal-panel styling with 3-dot headers (was rounded cards)
- **PublishPane** — wired to real Convex data (listRecentBundles query replaces mock data)
- **All pane headers, section labels, dividers** — now consistent across Settings, Billing, Sources, Portrait, Agents, Activity, Help, Publish

### Mobile Responsiveness

- **Auto-publish** on every bundle save (no manual /publish needed)
- **Profile sync** — saveBundleFromForm also updates profiles table

## 2026-03-20 — Identity System Unification + Private Layer + Docs

### Architecture
- **Profiles decoupled from auth** — profiles can exist without a user account
- **Unified identity system** — `profiles` is now the canonical table; `users` is auth-only
- When a user signs up, auto-creates or claims a profile entry
- Session-based profile claiming: `/create` sets cookie, `/initialize` claims on sign-up
- Context links are now profile-aware (profileId stored alongside userId)

### Private Layer + Security
- **privateContext table** — owner-only data (private notes, projects, internal links, calendar, investment thesis)
- **accessTokens table** — SHA-256 hashed tokens with scopes (read/write), expirable, revocable
- **securityLogs table** — audit trail for all profile events (created, claimed, reported, tokens)
- **profileReports table** — abuse reporting with 5 reason types
- **profileVerifications table** — multiple verification signals per profile
- Token validation endpoint: external agents validate tokens, get profile + private context based on scopes

### New Pages
- **`/create`** — no-auth profile creation (pick username, name, profile created instantly)
- **`/profiles`** — directory page listing all profiles from both systems
- **`/docs`** — terminal-styled documentation (getting started, /share, CLI, API, privacy, commands)

### Share Flow
- **`/share` command** — creates context link, generates copyable block, auto-copies to clipboard
- **`/share --private`** — includes private context for trusted agents
- Share block designed for pasting into any AI conversation

### UI Overhaul
- Centered terminal panels with colored dots (red/yellow/green) on auth, initialize, 404 pages
- Blinking block cursor (█) on terminal inputs
- Dashboard uses same TerminalHeader as other pages
- Profile page fully migrated to terminal design tokens
- Landing page CTAs point to `/create` instead of `/sign-up`
- ClaimBanner + ReportDialog components for unclaimed profiles
- 6 new shell panes: Sources, Portrait, Publish, Agents, Activity, Help
- Mobile keyboard scroll fix (100dvh + scrollIntoView)
- Orange focus ring killed on all terminal inputs
